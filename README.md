# What does it do?

Skse plugin that will load a coc (center on cell) console command and optionally execute it when you first load Skyrim from the desktop.

# CommonLibSSE NG

Because this uses [CommonLibSSE NG](https://github.com/CharmedBaryon/CommonLibSSE-NG), it supports Skyrim SE, AE, GOG, and VR.

[CommonLibSSE NG](https://github.com/CharmedBaryon/CommonLibSSE-NG) is a fork of the popular [powerof3 fork](https://github.com/powerof3/CommonLibSSE) of the _original_ `CommonLibSSE` library created by [Ryan McKenzie](https://github.com/Ryan-rsm-McKenzie) in [2018](https://github.com/Ryan-rsm-McKenzie/CommonLibSSE/commit/224773c424bdb8e36c761810cdff0fcfefda5f4a).

# Template
As of version 9.3, this uses the [commonlibSSE NG Template](https://github.com/Monitor221hz/CommonLibSSE-NG-Template-Plugin) provided by Monitor221hz.
